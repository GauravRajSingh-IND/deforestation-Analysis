# deforestation-Analysis
üå≥üîç Excited to share my latest project on Deforestation Analysis using OpenCV! üñ•Ô∏è‚ú®
I've been passionate about leveraging technology for environmental monitoring, and this project showcases how computer vision can aid in analyzing deforestation levels from video footage sourced from a Google Earth YouTube channel. 


Key Features:
Utilized HSV color space for precise detection of deforested, forested, and water areas.
Calculated and visualized deforestation percentage dynamically on each frame.
Applied contour detection to outline deforested regions for detailed analysis.
Created video outputs highlighting deforestation, forested, and water levels for further study.

Technologies Used:
OpenCV for image processing and contour detection.
Python for scripting and automation.
Matplotlib for visualizing intermediate results.

Detailed Analysis:
This project analyzes and visualizes deforested area, forested area, and water area within each frame, providing insights into environmental changes over time.
